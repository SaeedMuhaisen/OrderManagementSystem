# Order Management System

## Overview

The Order Management System (OMS) is a backend service designed to handle order placements, updates, and real-time tracking. The system provides real-time notifications to customers when the status of their orders changes, ensuring they are always informed about their order's progress. The OMS also includes secure authentication and role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
